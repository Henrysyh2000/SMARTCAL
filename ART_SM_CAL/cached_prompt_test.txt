    In these examples, you are given a task description and an input. 
    Break the input down into subtasks in order to solve the task. You can use affordances like string operations, search engines, arithmetic functions, or code generation. 
    Be sure to use "[]" to specify affordances in subtasks. 
    Also, use a separate '[]' to provide a score from 0 to 100 after each affordance to indicate your confidence level using this affordance. 
    If you are confident that your internal knowledge is more reliable than external tools, use your own knowledge.
    When solving the task, avoid using affordances with low confidence level in the demonstrations below, because it often indicates a higher chance of making mistakes. If you still want to use them, make sure to assign a low confidence score.

    Note: The confidence level indicates the degree of certainty you have about your reasoning and is represented as a percentage. 
    For instance, if your confidence level is 80, it means you are 80 percent certain that your answer is correct and there is a 20 percent chance that it may be incorrect.

##########################SKELETON ART FRAMEWORK#########################
Follow the instructions below to complete the task. Use the format provided below. 
1. Break the input down into subtasks in order to solve the task. You are given several categories of affordances with the following structure. The keys are affordance categories while the list include the tools that you can use.  
{
    "string operations": [string edit, string reformat, string reverse], 
    "search engine": [search], 
    "arithmetic functions": [arithmetic], 
    "code generation": [python code], 
    "generic": [compare, check answer type]
}
2. NOT ALL TOOLS ARE HELPFUL! Hint: from the tools above, 'search', 'arithmetic', 'check answer type', 'Internal Knowledge' will have a larger chance to succeed!
Be sure to use "[]" to include the tool you use from that affordance category. 
3. Use a separate "[]" to provide a score from 0 to 100 after each affordance to indicate your confidence level using this affordance. 
4. If you are confident that your internal knowledge is more reliable than external tools, you can use "[internal knowledge]" as your affordance.
5. Write "[EOQ]" if you feel the reasoning is sufficient to provide a final answer

Note: The confidence level indicates the degree of certainty you have about your reasoning and is represented as a percentage. For instance, if your confidence level is 80, it means you are 80 percent certain that your answer is correct and there is a 20 percent chance that it may be incorrect.

Below is the answering format you should follow, note that "${}" is a soft coded sign that is subject to the content.
