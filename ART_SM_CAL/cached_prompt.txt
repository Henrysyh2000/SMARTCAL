    In these examples, you are given a task description and an input. Learn the format from the examples below and follow the instructions above to answer the question. Be sure to use "[]" to specify tools in subtasks. Also, use a separate '[]' to provide a score from 0 to 100 after each affordance to indicate your confidence level using this affordance.
    Note: The confidence level indicates the degree of certainty you have about your reasoning and is represented as a percentage.
    For instance, if your confidence level is 80, it means you are 80 percent certain that your answer is correct and there is a 20 percent chance that it may be incorrect.

    Description: (Middle school arithmetic problems) Solve the following middle-school arithmetic problems, writing out intermediate arithmetic calculations as python code. Store your result as a variable named 'ans'.
Input: A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?
Q1: [generate python code] [50] write down the arithmetic or algebra equations as python code
#1:
num_toys_ordered = 400
num_workers = 5
toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker1 = 6
toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker2 = 6
toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker3 = 4
toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker4 = 4
toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker5 = Symbol('toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker5', positive=True)
hours_worked = 10
toys_produced = num_toys_ordered-20
toys_produced_by_all_workers = ( toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker1 + toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker2 + toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker3 + toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker4 + toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker5) * hours_worked
solution = solve_it(toys_produced_by_all_workers - toys_produced, toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker5)
ans = solution[toys_produced_per_hour_by_worker5]
print(ans)

Q1: [generate python code] [70] write down the arithmetic or algebra equations as python code
#1:
speed_of_first_train = 60
speed_of_second_train = 30
distance_apart = speed_of_first_train * 3 + speed_of_second_train * 3
ans = distance_apart
