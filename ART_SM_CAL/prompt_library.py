Input: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:

(B) Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship
Q1: [think step-by-step] 
#1: Let's think step-by-step. When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 < 2 < 6 < 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 < 1 < 8 < 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

Options:

Q1: [think step-by-step] 
#1:
Let's think step-by-step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 < 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:

- invalid
Q1: [think step-by-step] 
#1: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.

Description: (Reasoning about colored objects) Given a collection of colored objects in the text input, answer the question at the end of the input.
Input: On the table, you see a bunch of objects arranged in a row: a purple paperclip, a pink stress ball, a brown keychain, a green scrunchiephone charger, a mauve fidget spinner, and a burgundy pen. What is the color of the object directly to the right of the stress ball?
Q1: [think step-by-step] 
#1: Let's think step by step.
According to this question, the objects are arranged in a row, from left to right, as follows: (1) a purple paperclip, (2) a pink stress ball, (3) a brown keychain, (4) a green scrunchiephone charger, (5) a mauve fidget spinner, (6) a burgundy pen.
The stress ball is the second object on the list, namely (2). The object that is to the right of the stress ball corresponds to (3), which is a brown keychain.
The color of the keychain is brown. So the answer is brown.
Q2: [EOQ]
